## Overview
This repository contains Jupyter/Colab notebooks used to explore whether local environmental variations in the SFH time-flow field can account for the observed Hubble-constant tension.

The analysis uses the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova compilation and follows the methodology described in the associated Zenodo preprint.

## Contents
- `SFH_FastFlowBubble_Pantheon_LocalBubble.ipynb`  
  Main reproducible analysis notebook (Google Colab compatible).

## Data
- Pantheon+ SH0ES supernova data are loaded manually by the user.
- No modified or proprietary datasets are included in this repository.

## How to run
Click the **Open in Colab** badge above and follow the instructions in the notebook header.
